    <h1><u>“War on History” Project</u></h1>
    <p>by Jane Pauley-DeLapp</p>
    <p>for Mr. Goldman's genocide class, October 2023</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 2em; text-align: justify; width: 60vw;">
      For my project, I decided to focus on the targeting of Armenian intellectuals at the beginning of the genocide. I would categorize this action by the Turkish government as a strategic one: they deliberately began their genocide with writers, educators, and academics—Armenians’ cultural leaders—to reduce the extent to which the targets were unified. Some sources I read described the move as a “decapitation”, which I think is apt. These intellectuals served as the “head” of the culture via their art and teaching (at least, as best I can tell—it is difficult researching the culture, mood, and sentiments of a people separated from oneself by a century, an ocean, and a language). Hence, by first removing its head, the Ottoman government hoped to curb the Armenians’ cultural unity—like how if today one wished to commit a genocide against American teenagers, a first step would be eliminating social media. <br><br>
      In researching this topic as well as throughout this unit and the course as a whole, what I have found most troubling and captivating is the question, “how could someone do that?” One thing that genocide is is horrible, but another is absurd. The notion that one could end the lives of millions of people based on something so trivial as race or religion evokes some of the same things as Kafka or Monty Python: such an idea is so preposterous and so far removed from anything I understand about life that it is impossible for me to really understand how someone like Talaat can arrive at a place where that idea seems normal. I think the orchestrators of genocide are operating from a position detached from reality, because here in reality, you don’t just kill people, and you certainly don’t execute a multi-stage plan at large scale with the sole purpose of killing people. It doesn’t make sense. <br><br>
      I aimed to explore this absurdity in this digital storybook using a dichotomy between a reasonable perspective (wherein the Armenian intellectuals are viewed as people worthy of respect) and an unreasonable perspective (that of the Ottoman government). To do this, I used the specific example of one of the Red Sunday targets, Erukhan, who was a writer. He fled Turkey during the massacres circa 1896, but returned to Constantinople when it seemed that relations between Turks and Armenians were improving—just in time for the CUP to come into power and commence the genocide. I could have used any number of people for this case study, as Erukhan is not at all unique: nearly all of the arrested intellectuals I looked into had very similar stories. It’s terrible to know that this fate was so common, but in some ways it is slightly comforting that Erukhan’s story is shared by a hundred of his contemporaries.
